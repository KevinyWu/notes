Conceptual comparison of three contrastive loss mechanisms (empirical comparisons are in Figure 3 and Table 3). Here we illustrate one pair of query and key. The three mechanisms differ in how the keys are maintained and how the key encoder is updated. (a): The encoders for computing the query and key representations are updated end-fo-end by back-propagation (the two encoders can be different). (b): The key representations are sampled from a memory bank [61]. (c): MoCo encodes the new keys on-the-fly by a momentum-updated encoder, and maintains a queue (not illustrated in this figure) of keys.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
