[[Self-Improving Autonomous Underwater Manipulation]]
- AquaBot combines behavioral cloning (BC) from human demonstrations with self-learning optimization, enhancing manipulation performance by 41% over human teleoperation
- AquaBot learns through BC using an 8D action vector to encode movements, followed by a self-learning phase that optimizes task speed parameters using a neural surrogate model
- AquaBot demonstrated proficiency in object grasping, trash sorting, and rescue retrieval, autonomously handling diverse object types and overcoming underwater challenges such as non-linear fluid dynamics and current-induced uncertainties
