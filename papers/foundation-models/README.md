[[Octo - An Open-Source Generalist Robot Policy]]
- Octo is a large transformer-based generalist robot policy trained on 800k robot trajectories from the Open X-Embodiment dataset, supporting both natural language and goal image conditioning for versatile task execution
- The model uses a transformer architecture to integrate multimodal inputs, allowing for quick finetuning across diverse robotic platforms and tasks
- Action chunking and a diffusion-based action prediction mechanism improves performance over traditional methods like ResNet encoders or discrete action heads
