[[Autonomous Drone Racing - A Survey]]
- Classic approach: perception -> planning -> control pipeline
- Learning-based approaches replace one or more of the above three modules with a neural network; require less compute and are more robust to latency and senor noise, but need more data
- Open questions: reliable state estimation, flying from purely vision, multiplayer racing, safety, transfer to real-world applications where environment is unknown, safe lifelong RL (exploration without crashing)
