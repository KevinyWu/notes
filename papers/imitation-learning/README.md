[[A Comparison of Imitation Learning Algorithms for Bimanual Manipulation]]
- RL is hard for manipulation, need good rewards for all areas of environment
- Imitation learning (specifically BC) does not need an explicit reward function
- Diffusion Policy and ACT perform the best, but there are only simulated experiments (no real-robot)
