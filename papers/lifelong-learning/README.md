## [1995-01] Lifelong Robot Learning

[[Lifelong Robot Learning]]
- Robots will need to face hostile real-world environments, so an advantage of exploration is that All empirically learned knowledge is grounded in the real world
- Across tasks, EBNN: Explanation-Based Neural Networks, learn the evaluation function $Q$ match both outputs and partial derivatives of the action model
- Across environments, we can still learn invariants in signals, learning a function $\mathcal{R}$ that maps sonar scans to probability of collision

## [2024-10] Self-Improving Autonomous Underwater Manipulation

[[Self-Improving Autonomous Underwater Manipulation]]
- AquaBot combines behavioral cloning (BC) from human demonstrations with self-learning optimization, enhancing manipulation performance by 41% over human teleoperation
- AquaBot learns through BC using an 8D action vector to encode movements, followed by a self-learning phase that optimizes task speed parameters using a neural surrogate model
- AquaBot demonstrated proficiency in object grasping, trash sorting, and rescue retrieval, autonomously handling diverse object types and overcoming underwater challenges such as non-linear fluid dynamics and current-induced uncertainties
