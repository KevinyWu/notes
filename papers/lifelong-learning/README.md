[[Lifelong Robot Learning]]
- Robots will need to face hostile real-world environments, so an advantage of exploration is that All empirically learned knowledge is grounded in the real world
- Across tasks, EBNN: Explanation-Based Neural Networks, learn the evaluation function $Q$ match both outputs and partial derivatives of the action model
- Across environments, we can still learn invariants in signals, learning a function $\mathcal{R}$ that maps sonar scans to probability of collision
