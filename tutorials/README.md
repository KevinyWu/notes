## [2024-07-19] Supervised Policy Learning for Real Robots

[[Supervised Policy Learning for Real Robots]]
- Behavioral Cloning (BC) shows promise by enabling robots to perform complex tasks using RGB inputs without explicit state estimation or dynamics
- Limitations include high data/computation needs, slow inference, and challenges with robustness, though success could lead to physical common sense in robotics
- We don't completely understand the use of proprioception, continuous vs discrete actions, context lengths, etc.
