[[1 An Informal Introduction]]
- If we can identify the low-dimensional surface on which the segment samples lie, we can identify the predictive function
- Neural networks can learn low-dimensional representations for data with nonlinear distributions
- Autoencoder: learns a compressive coding scheme $\mathcal{E}$ to identify low-dim structures in $X$ to predict things in the space of $X$
