## Summary of Works

- Task specification
    - VoxPoser
- Low-level modeling
    - RepKep
- High-level modeling
    - RoboEXP
    - Missing piece: action

## Foundation Models

- VoxPoser
    - Use foundation model to interpret natural language instructions
    - Code is multilingual interface between humans, foundation models, and robot
- Future of robotic foundation models
    - Output may not always be perfect, but should always generate something reasonable!
