[[Tom Silver - Neuro-Symbolic Learning for Bilevel Robot Planning|Talk]]
- Unified framework for task and motion planning (TAMP)
- Unsupervised learning of predicate-operator based state abstractions for planning
- Optimization problem: find trajectory of **low-level** states and actions so that **high-level** abstract states are followed, transitions are valid
