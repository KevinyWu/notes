## Task and Motion Planning

- Goal: solve long-horizon contact-rich tasks
- Most work has been reasoning over geometry
    - **Need to reason over geometry and physics**
- Example: cutting cucumber, need to reason over force

## Forceful Manipulation

- Opening a childproof bottle (push and twist)
    - Must hold bottle still
    - Robot must be strong enough
- **Each joint must satisfy wrench (torque and force) constraint**
    - Represent bottle-opening process as kinematic chain
    - Robot joints
        - Manipulator Jacobian transpose maps end-effector wrench to joint torques, parametrized by joint angles
        - Use this to check if all joints satisfy robot's torque limit
    - Frictional joints via contact
        - Robot on bottle, bottle on table
        - Both are planar joints
        - Friction: limit surface
            - **Ellipsoidal approximation**
            - If exerted wrench lies in the boundary of the ellipse, we have enough friction to twist the cap
            - **Not satisfied! bottle slips**
- How to plan with these constraints?
    - **Action: parametrized controller**
        - Characterized by preconditions (what needs to be true about the world to run the action) and effects (what changes in the state)
        - Ex place, move, push
    - Problem: find a sequence of actions and their parameters subject to constraints
        - TAMP framework: PDDLStream planner
        - Must specify the streams in the planner
        - Planner searches for parameters and actions given constraints
        - Ex. to open the bottle, output of planner could be: move(params), pick(params), move(params), pushtwist-tool(params) â€¦

## In-Hand Manipulation

- Often, you need to change the grasp of objects **in-hand**
- Assume there is a wall in environment to push objects against
- Problem
    - Given initial grasp and final grasp and where in environment we can push against, plan a pushing strategy
- **Motion cone**: the set of feasible motions that a rigid body can follow under the action of a frictional push
    - Need to construct a motion cone, then compose these to find a strategy

## Robust Decision Making

- Cutting a cucumber
    - Many ways to grasp knift
    - Different grasp better in different scenarios
- Experiment: perturb physical parameters from first section
    - Cost of an action is the negative log of the probability of success using that action under many different perturbations

## Guarded Planning

- Action uncertainty in dynamic manipulation
    - **Dynamic non-prehensile actions (DNP)**: action without grasping
    - Highly uncertain action!
    - Also hard to model with classical mechanics
- Learn a model
    - Collect sparse amount of demonstrations
    - learn **outcome volumes**: capture the space of resulting configurations given the action
