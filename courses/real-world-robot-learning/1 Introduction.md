## Why is Real-World Robot Learning Hard?

- Moravec's Paradox
	- Things that are easy for computers are hard for humans and vice versa
- We don't have the right data, enough data, or the right objectives
- Challenges: safety, computational efficiency, stuff breaks

## Why Care about Real-World Robot Learning?

- Why care about learning?
	- If your task is well defined, other stuff might work better (e.g. Roomba)
	- We have not yet figured out how to build robots that are as adaptable as humans; learning seems promising (look at CV + NLP)
	- Science! Emergence of Intelligence is probably the biggest mystery in the universe
- Why care about real-world?
	- We can't yet model everything, need to deal with uncertainty
	- Our models are limited by human cognition
	- You are as smart as the environment requires, no reset or undo
